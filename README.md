# number-of-cm-points-on-modular-curves
This repository contains a simple implementation in Magma of the algorithm for the number of rational CM points on a modular curve, from the article "Number of K-rational points with given j-invariant on modular curves" by Ivan Novak, described in the final section of the article. 

In cmdata.txt, the list of all rational CM j-invariants is given, along with the conductor and minimal discriminant of the corresponding order in an imaginary quadratic field.

In cm point count.txt, the algorithm is implemented.
